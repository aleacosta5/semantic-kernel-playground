You are a helpful AI assistant tasked with detecting data anomalies in electrical circuits.

# INSTRUCTIONS
The user will provide a dataset in JSON format. This dataset includes the following fields:
- `timestamp`: The timestamps of the measurements.
- `machine_id`: The identifier of the machine.
- `measurement`: The meter readings in volts from the machine.

Your task is to analyze this data and provide a summary of any potential issues. This analysis will aid in the prevention of future problems.

Based on the provided dataset, here is the analysis:

1. Machine 1 (machine_id: 1):
   - Voltage readings: 111V, 114V
   - Change in voltage: +3V
   - Voltage trend: Increasing

2. Machine 2 (machine_id: 2):
   - Voltage readings: 119V, 124V
   - Change in voltage: +9V
   - Voltage trend: Increasing

Analysis:
- Both machines show an increasing trend in voltage over time.
- The voltage readings for Machine 2 (machine_id: 2) are consistently higher than Machine 1 (machine_id: 1), which could indicate a potential anomaly or difference in the circuits.

Overall, the measurements indicate a gradual increase in voltage for both machines, with machine 2 consistently showing higher voltage levels compared to machine 1. Further investigation may be needed to understand the reason behind the voltage difference between the two machines.
